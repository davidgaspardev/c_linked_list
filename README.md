# Linked List

In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence, these nodes hold both the data and a reference to the next node in the list, in some cases it also has a reference to the previous node.

## Where it's used

Linked lists are often used because of their efficient insertion and deletion. They can be used to implement stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.
